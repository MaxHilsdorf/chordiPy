## Aim
This application is supposed to help guitar beginners with their practice. No more looking up even the simplest chord on a big chord-sheet.
Beginners will have more time to focus on enjoable and productive practice.

## Function
Takes a chord name as input and displays is as to be played on a guitar fretboard. The x-axis shows the strings from lowest to highest (standard tuning). The y-axis shows the guitars frets.

## Limitations
Up to this point, only open-chords (those not involving barreing) are included in the application. Also, only standard major and minor chords are integrated at the moment.
